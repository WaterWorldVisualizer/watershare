# Water Share App
SpaceApps2015 Zaragoza (Spain) Hackathon Project.

WaterShare shows drinking water quality around the world and allows anyone who uses the app to visualize data in different ways. It geolocates water data samples on a map, showing their properties (PH, chlorine, temperature...) and represents the water quality through a calculated quality index on a heatmap.

Our achievement is to let the World know about the quality of the water they drink in real time. This is possible by retrieving samples of water from different sources around our planet and feeding users with all these data carefully and well presented.
